# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to **warsono@gits.id**.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed. 

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Morpheme UI and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
